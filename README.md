## Production and test in system administration.

This project is part of the IT Support Professional Certificate!

### Introduction
As a system administrator, it's important to always have a test environment where you can do changes without affecting the production environment that is being used to serve your users.

It's also important to have a clear reproduction case that can be used to verify that the problem that you are trying to solve is actually fixed.

### Project details
In this lab, I experimented with fixing a problem through first finding a reproduction case, then making changes in a test environment and finally applying the changes to the production environment.
